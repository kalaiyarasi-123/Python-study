k="""Late at night, Emma found an old, 
    dusty key hidden under a loose floorboard.
    Curiosity led her to the attic, 
    where she discovered a locked chest that seemed to hum with energy. 
    As she turned the key, the chest creaked open, 
    revealing a portal to a world she never imagined."""
